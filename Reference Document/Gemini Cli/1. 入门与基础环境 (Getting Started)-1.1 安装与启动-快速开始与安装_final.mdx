# Get started with Gemini CLI

Welcome to Gemini CLI! This guide will help you install, configure, and start
using the Gemini CLI to enhance your workflow right from your terminal.

<AdPlaceholder />

## Quickstart: Install, authenticate, configure, and use Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI brings the power of advanced language models directly to your command
line interface. As an AI-powered assistant, Gemini CLI can help you with a
variety of tasks, from understanding and generating code to reviewing and
editing documents.

## Install

The standard method to install and run Gemini CLI uses `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

Once Gemini CLI is installed, run Gemini CLI from your command line:

```bash
gemini
```

For more installation options, see [Gemini CLI Installation](/docs/get-started/installation).

## Authenticate

To begin using Gemini CLI, you must authenticate with a Google service. In most
cases, you can log in with your existing Google account:

1. Run Gemini CLI after installation:

   ```bash
   gemini
   ```

2. When asked "How would you like to authenticate for this project?" select **1.
   Login with Google**.

3. Select your Google account.

4. Click on **Sign in**.

Certain account types may require you to configure a Google Cloud project. For
more information, including other authentication methods, see
[Gemini CLI Authentication Setup](/docs/get-started/authentication).

## Configure

Gemini CLI offers several ways to configure its behavior, including environment
variables, command-line arguments, and settings files.

To explore your configuration options, see
[Gemini CLI Configuration](/docs/get-started/configuration).

## Use

Once installed and authenticated, you can start using Gemini CLI by issuing
commands and prompts in your terminal. Ask it to generate code, explain files,
and more.

To explore the power of Gemini CLI, see [Gemini CLI examples](/docs/get-started/examples).

# Gemini CLI installation, execution, and deployment

Install and run Gemini CLI. This document provides an overview of Gemini CLI's
installation methods and deployment architecture.

## How to install and/or run Gemini CLI

There are several ways to run Gemini CLI. The recommended option depends on how
you intend to use Gemini CLI.

- As a standard installation. This is the most straightforward method of using
  Gemini CLI.
- In a sandbox. This method offers increased security and isolation.
- From the source. This is recommended for contributors to the project.

### 1. Standard installation (recommended for standard users)

This is the recommended way for end-users to install Gemini CLI. It involves
downloading the Gemini CLI package from the NPM registry.

- **Global install:**

  ```bash
  npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
  ```

  Then, run the CLI from anywhere:

  ```bash
  gemini
  ```

- **NPX execution:**

  ```bash
  # Execute the latest version from NPM without a global install
  npx @google/gemini-cli
  ```

### 2. Run in a sandbox (Docker/Podman)

For security and isolation, Gemini CLI can be run inside a container. This is
the default way that the CLI executes tools that might have side effects.

- **Directly from the registry:** You can run the published sandbox image
  directly. This is useful for environments where you only have Docker and want
  to run the CLI.
  ```bash
  # Run the published sandbox image
  docker run --rm -it us-docker.pkg.dev/gemini-code-dev/gemini-cli/sandbox:0.1.1
  ```
- **Using the `--sandbox` flag:** If you have Gemini CLI installed locally
  (using the standard installation described above), you can instruct it to
  run inside the sandbox container.
  ```bash
  gemini --sandbox -y -p "your prompt here"
  ```

### 3. Run from source (recommended for Gemini CLI contributors)

Contributors to the project will want to run the CLI directly from the source
code.

- **Development mode:** This method provides hot-reloading and is useful for
  active development.
  ```bash
  # From the root of the repository
  npm run start
  ```
- **Production-like mode (linked package):** This method simulates a global
  installation by linking your local package. It's useful for testing a local
  build in a production workflow.

  ```bash
  # Link the local cli package to your global node_modules
  npm link packages/cli

  # Now you can run your local version using the `gemini` command
  gemini
  ```

---

### 4. Running the latest Gemini CLI commit from GitHub

You can run the most recently committed version of Gemini CLI directly from the
GitHub repository. This is useful for testing features still in development.

```bash
# Execute the CLI directly from the main branch on GitHub
npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

## Deployment architecture

The execution methods described above are made possible by the following
architectural components and processes:

**NPM packages**

Gemini CLI project is a monorepo that publishes two core packages to the NPM
registry:

- `@google/gemini-cli-core`: The backend, handling logic and tool execution.
- `@google/gemini-cli`: The user-facing frontend.

These packages are used when performing the standard installation and when
running Gemini CLI from the source.

**Build and packaging processes**

There are two distinct build processes used, depending on the distribution
channel:

- **NPM publication:** For publishing to the NPM registry, the TypeScript source
  code in `@google/gemini-cli-core` and `@google/gemini-cli` is transpiled into
  standard JavaScript using the TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`). The resulting
  `dist/` directory is what gets published in the NPM package. This is a
  standard approach for TypeScript libraries.

- **GitHub `npx` execution:** When running the latest version of Gemini CLI
  directly from GitHub, a different process is triggered by the `prepare` script
  in `package.json`. This script uses `esbuild` to bundle the entire application
  and its dependencies into a single, self-contained JavaScript file. This
  bundle is created on-the-fly on the user's machine and is not checked into the
  repository.

**Docker sandbox image**

The Docker-based execution method is supported by the `gemini-cli-sandbox`
container image. This image is published to a container registry and contains a
pre-installed, global version of Gemini CLI.

## Release process

The release process is automated through GitHub Actions. The release workflow
performs the following actions:

1.  Build the NPM packages using `tsc`.
2.  Publish the NPM packages to the artifact registry.
3.  Create GitHub releases with bundled assets.
