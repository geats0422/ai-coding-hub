## Overview

The Trusted Folders feature allows you to specify directories that are considered
safe for Gemini CLI operations. This helps prevent accidental modifications to
sensitive or important directories.

## Configuration

To configure trusted folders, you need to modify your `settings.json` file.

### Settings structure

```json
{
  "security": {
    "trustedFolders": [
      "/path/to/trusted/directory",
      "/another/trusted/path"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage

When trusted folders are configured, Gemini CLI will:

- Allow file operations within trusted directories without additional warnings
- Potentially restrict operations outside of trusted folders
- Provide enhanced safety guarantees for important project directories

## Best practices

- Only add directories that you explicitly trust
- Regularly review your trusted folders list
- Be cautious when adding system directories
- Consider using absolute paths for reliability
