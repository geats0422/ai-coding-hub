<AdPlaceholder />

OpenCode is an open source AI coding agent. It's available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.

<AdPlaceholder />

## Prerequisites

To use OpenCode in your terminal, you'll need:

A modern terminal emulator like:

WezTerm, cross-platform
Alacritty, cross-platform
Ghostty, Linux and macOS
Kitty, Linux and macOS
API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

## Install

The easiest way to install OpenCode is through the install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

You can also install it with the following commands:

Using Node.js

- npm
```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
```
- Bun
```bash
bun install -g opencode-ai
```
- pnpm
```bash
pnup install -g opencode-ai
```
Yarn
```bash
yarn global add opencode-ai
```

Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux

```bash
brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode
```

<Callout type="tip">
We recommend using the OpenCode tap for the most up to date releases. The official brew install opencode formula is maintained by the Homebrew team and is updated less frequently.
</Callout>

Using Paru on Arch Linux

```bash
paru -S opencode-bin
```

<Callout type="warning">
Recommended: Use WSL
For the best experience on Windows, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It provides better performance and full compatibility with OpenCode's features.
</Callout>

Using Chocolatey
```bash
choco install opencode
```

Using Scoop
```bash
scoop install opencode
```

Using NPM

```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

Using Mise

```bash
mise use -g github:anomalyco/opencode
```

Using Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/anomalyco/opencode
```

Support for installing OpenCode on Windows using Bun is currently in progress.

You can also grab the binary from the Releases.

## Configure

With OpenCode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

If you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using OpenCode Zen. It's a curated list of models that have been tested and verified by the OpenCode team.

Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to opencode.ai/auth.

```bash
/connect
```

Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.

Paste your API key.

```bash
┌ API key
│
│
└ enter
```

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers. Learn more.

## Initialize

Now that you've configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that you want to work on.

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

And run OpenCode.

```bash
opencode
```

Next, initialize OpenCode for the project by running the following command.

```bash
/init
```

This will get OpenCode to analyze your project and create an AGENTS.md file in the project root.

<Callout type="tip">
You should commit your project's AGENTS.md file to Git.
</Callout>

This helps OpenCode understand the project structure and the coding patterns used.

## Usage

You are now ready to use OpenCode to work on your project. Feel free to ask it anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might help.

## Ask questions

You can ask OpenCode to explain the codebase to you.

<Callout type="tip">
Use the @ key to fuzzy search for files in the project.
</Callout>

```bash
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

This is helpful if there's a part of the codebase that you didn't work on.

## Add features

You can ask OpenCode to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

Create a plan

OpenCode has a Plan mode that disables its ability to make changes and instead suggest how it'll implement the feature.

Switch to it using the `Tab` key. You'll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.

```bash
<TAB>
```

Now let's describe what we want it to do.

```bash
When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.
Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.
From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
```

You want to give OpenCode enough details to understand what you want. It helps to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.

<Callout type="tip">
Give OpenCode plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you want.
</Callout>

Iterate on the plan

Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.

```bash
We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.
[Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.
```

<Callout type="tip">
Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.
</Callout>

OpenCode can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.

Build the feature

Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to Build mode by hitting the `Tab` key again.

```bash
<TAB>
```

And asking it to make the changes.

```bash
Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
```

## Make changes

For more straightforward changes, you can ask OpenCode to directly build it without having to review the plan first.

```bash
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this is
handled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implement
the same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts
```

You want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so OpenCode makes the right changes.

## Undo changes

Let's say you ask OpenCode to make some changes.

Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?

But you realize that it is not what you wanted. You can undo the changes using the `/undo` command.

```bash
/undo
```

OpenCode will now revert the changes you made and show your original message again.

```bash
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

From here you can tweak the prompt and ask OpenCode to try again.

<Callout type="tip">
You can run /undo multiple times to undo multiple changes.
</Callout>

Or you can redo the changes using the `/redo` command.

```bash
/redo
```

## Share

The conversations that you have with OpenCode can be shared with your team.

```bash
/share
```

This will create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.

<Callout type="note">
Conversations are not shared by default.
</Callout>

Here's an example conversation with OpenCode.

## Customize

And that's it! You are now a pro at using OpenCode.

To make it your own, we recommend picking a theme, customizing the keybinds, configuring code formatters, creating custom commands, or playing around with the OpenCode config.
