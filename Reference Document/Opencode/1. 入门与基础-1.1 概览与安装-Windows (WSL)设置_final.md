While OpenCode can run directly on Windows, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for the best experience. WSL provides a Linux environment that works seamlessly with OpenCode's features.

<Callout type="tip">
WSL offers better file system performance, full terminal support, and compatibility with development tools that OpenCode relies on.
</Callout>

## Setup

1. Install WSL
   - If you haven't already, install WSL using the official Microsoft guide.

2. Install OpenCode in WSL
   - Once WSL is set up, open your WSL terminal and install OpenCode using one of the installation methods.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
   ```

3. Use OpenCode from WSL
   - Navigate to your project directory (access Windows files via /mnt/c/, /mnt/d/, etc.) and run OpenCode.
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/project
   opencode
   ```

## Desktop App + WSL Server

If you prefer using the OpenCode Desktop app but want to run the server in WSL:

Start the server in WSL with --hostname 0.0.0.0 to allow external connections:

```bash
opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4096
```

Connect the Desktop app to http://localhost:4096

<Callout type="note">
If localhost does not work in your setup, connect using the WSL IP address instead (from WSL: hostname -I) and use http://<wsl-ip>:4096.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
When using --hostname 0.0.0.0, set OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD to secure the server.
</Callout>

```bash
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-password opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

## Web Client + WSL

For the best web experience on Windows:

Run opencode web in the WSL terminal rather than PowerShell:

```bash
opencode web --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

Access from your Windows browser at http://localhost:<port> (OpenCode prints the URL)

Running opencode web from WSL ensures proper file system access and terminal integration while still being accessible from your Windows browser.

## Accessing Windows Files

WSL can access all your Windows files through the /mnt/ directory:

C: drive → /mnt/c/
D: drive → /mnt/d/
And so on…
Example:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/project
opencode
```

<Callout type="tip">
For the smoothest experience, consider cloning/copying your repo into the WSL filesystem (for example under ~/code/) and running OpenCode there.
</Callout>

## Tips

- Keep OpenCode running in WSL for projects stored on Windows drives - file access is seamless
- Use VS Code's WSL extension alongside OpenCode for an integrated development workflow
- Your OpenCode config and sessions are stored within the WSL environment at ~/.local/share/opencode/
