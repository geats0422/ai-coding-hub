<AdPlaceholder />

OpenCode provides an interactive terminal interface or TUI for working on your projects with an LLM.

Running OpenCode starts the TUI for the current directory.

```bash
opencode
```

Or you can start it for a specific working directory.

```bash
opencode /path/to/project
```

Once you're in the TUI, you can prompt it with a message.

```bash
Give me a quick summary of the codebase.
```

## File references

You can reference files in your messages using @. This does a fuzzy file search in the current working directory.

<Callout type="tip">
You can also use @ to reference files in your messages.
</Callout>

```bash
How is auth handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

The content of the file is added to the conversation automatically.

## Bash commands

Start a message with ! to run a shell command.

```bash
!ls -la
```

The output of the command is added to the conversation as a tool result.

## Commands

When using the OpenCode TUI, you can type / followed by a command name to quickly execute actions. For example:

```bash
/help
```

Most commands also have keybind using `ctrl+x` as the leader key, where `ctrl+x` is the default leader key. Learn more.

Here are all available slash commands:

### connect

Add a provider to OpenCode. Allows you to select from available providers and add their API keys.

```bash
/connect
```

### compact

Compact the current session. Alias: /summarize

```bash
/compact
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x c`

### details

Toggle tool execution details.

```bash
/details
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x d`

### editor

Open external editor for composing messages. Uses the editor set in your EDITOR environment variable. Learn more.

```bash
/editor
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x e`

### exit

Exit OpenCode. Aliases: /quit, /q

```bash
/exit
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x q`

### export

Export current conversation to Markdown and open in your default editor. Uses the editor set in your EDITOR environment variable. Learn more.

```bash
/export
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x x`

### help

Show the help dialog.

```bash
/help
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x h`

### init

Create or update AGENTS.md file. Learn more.

```bash
/init
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x i`

### models

List available models.

```bash
/models
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x m`

### new

Start a new session. Alias: /clear

```bash
/new
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x n`

### redo

Redo a previously undone message. Only available after using /undo.

<Callout type="tip">
Any file changes will also be restored.
</Callout>

Internally, this uses Git to manage the file changes. So your project needs to be a Git repository.

```bash
/redo
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x r`

### sessions

List and switch between sessions. Aliases: /resume, /continue

```bash
/sessions
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x l`

### share

Share current session. Learn more.

```bash
/share
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x s`

### themes

List available themes.

```bash
/theme
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x t`

### thinking

Toggle the visibility of thinking/reasoning blocks in the conversation. When enabled, you can see the model's reasoning process for models that support extended thinking.

<Callout type="note">
This command only controls whether thinking blocks are displayed - it does not enable or disable the model's reasoning capabilities. To toggle actual reasoning capabilities, use `ctrl+t` to cycle through model variants.
</Callout>

```bash
/thinking
```

### undo

Undo last message in the conversation. Removes the most recent user message, all subsequent responses, and any file changes.

<Callout type="tip">
Any file changes made will also be reverted.
</Callout>

Internally, this uses Git to manage the file changes. So your project needs to be a Git repository.

```bash
/undo
```

Keybind: `ctrl+x u`

### unshare

Unshare current session. Learn more.

```bash
/unshare
```

## Editor setup

Both the /editor and /export commands use the editor specified in your EDITOR environment variable.

**Linux/macOS**

```bash
# Example for nano or vim
export EDITOR=nano
export EDITOR=vim

# For GUI editors, VS Code, Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf, Zed, etc.
# include --wait
export EDITOR="code --wait"
```

To make it permanent, add this to your shell profile; ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.

Popular editor options include:

- `code` - Visual Studio Code
- `cursor` - Cursor
- `windsurf` - Windsurf
- `nvim` - Neovim editor
- `vim` - Vim editor
- `nano` - Nano editor
- `notepad` - Windows Notepad
- `subl` - Sublime Text

<Callout type="note">
Some editors like VS Code need to be started with the --wait flag.
</Callout>

Some editors need command-line arguments to run in blocking mode. The --wait flag makes the editor process block until closed.

## Configure

You can customize TUI behavior through your OpenCode config file.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tui": {
    "scroll_speed": 3,
    "scroll_acceleration": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Options

- `scroll_acceleration` - Enable macOS-style scroll acceleration for smooth, natural scrolling. When enabled, scroll speed increases with rapid scrolling gestures and stays precise for slower movements. This setting takes precedence over scroll_speed and overrides it when enabled.
- `scroll_speed` - Controls how fast the TUI scrolls when using scroll commands (minimum: 1). Defaults to 3. Note: This is ignored if scroll_acceleration.enabled is set to true.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the TUI view using the command palette (`ctrl+x h` or /help). These settings persist across restarts.

### Username display

Toggle whether your username appears in chat messages. Access this through:

- Command palette: Search for "username" or "hide username"
- The setting persists automatically and will be remembered across TUI sessions
