<AdPlaceholder />

OpenCode uses the AI SDK and Models.dev to support 75+ LLM providers and it supports running local models.

To add a provider you need to:

1. Add the API keys for the provider using the /connect command.
2. Configure the provider in your OpenCode config.

## Credentials

When you add a provider's API keys with the /connect command, they are stored in ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json.

## Config

You can customize the providers through the provider section in your OpenCode config.

### Base URL

You can customize the base URL for any provider by setting the baseURL option. This is useful when using proxy services or custom endpoints.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## OpenCode Zen

OpenCode Zen is a list of models provided by the OpenCode team that have been tested and verified to work well with OpenCode. Learn more.

<Callout type="tip">
If you are new, we recommend starting with OpenCode Zen.
</Callout>

Run the /connect command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to opencode.ai/auth.

```bash
/connect
```

Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.

Paste your API key.

```bash
┌ API key
│
│
└ enter
```

Run /models in the TUI to see the list of models we recommend.

```bash
/models
```

It works like any other provider in OpenCode and is completely optional to use.

## Directory

Let's look at some of the providers in detail. If you'd like to add a provider to the list, feel free to open a PR.

<Callout type="note">

</Callout>

### 302.AI

Head over to the 302.AI console, create an account, and generate an API key.

Run the /connect command and search for 302.AI.

```bash
/connect
```

Enter your 302.AI API key.

```bash
┌ API key
│
│
└ enter
```

Run the /models command to select a model.

```bash
/models
```

### Amazon Bedrock

To use Amazon Bedrock with OpenCode:

Head over to the Model catalog in the Amazon Bedrock console and request access to the models you want.

<Callout type="tip">
You need to have access to the model you want in Amazon Bedrock.
</Callout>

Configure authentication using one of the following methods:

#### Environment Variables (Quick Start)

Set one of these environment variables while running opencode:

```bash
# Option 1: Using AWS access keys
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYY opencode

# Option 2: Using named AWS profile
AWS_PROFILE=my-profile opencode

# Option 3: Using Bedrock bearer token
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=XXX opencode
```

Or add them to your bash profile:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=my-dev-profile
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### Configuration File (Recommended)

For project-specific or persistent configuration, use opencode.json:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "amazon-bedrock": {
      "options": {
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "profile": "my-aws-profile"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Available options:

- `region` - AWS region (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1)
- `profile` - AWS named profile from ~/.aws/credentials
- `endpoint` - Custom endpoint URL for VPC endpoints (alias for generic baseURL option)

<Callout type="tip">
Configuration file options take precedence over environment variables.
</Callout>

#### Advanced: VPC Endpoints

If you're using VPC endpoints for Bedrock:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "amazon-bedrock": {
      "options": {
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "profile": "production",
        "endpoint": "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.vpce-xxxxx.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="note">
The endpoint option is an alias for the generic baseURL option, using AWS-specific terminology. If both endpoint and baseURL are specified, endpoint takes precedence.
</Callout>

#### Authentication Methods

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Create an IAM user and generate access keys in the AWS Console
- AWS_PROFILE: Use named profiles from ~/.aws/credentials. First configure with `aws configure --profile my-profile` or `aws sso login`
- AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK: Generate long-term API keys from the Amazon Bedrock console
- AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE / AWS_ROLE_ARN: For EKS IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) or other Kubernetes environments with OIDC federation. These environment variables are automatically injected by Kubernetes when using service account annotations.

#### Authentication Precedence

Amazon Bedrock uses the following authentication priority:

1. Bearer Token - AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK environment variable or token from /connect command
2. AWS Credential Chain - Profile, access keys, shared credentials, IAM roles, Web Identity Tokens (EKS IRSA), instance metadata

<Callout type="note">
When a bearer token is set (via /connect or AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK), it takes precedence over all AWS credential methods including configured profiles.
</Callout>

Run the /models command to select the model you want.

```bash
/models
```

<Callout type="note">
For custom inference profiles, use the model and provider name in the key and set the id property to the arn. This ensures correct caching:
</Callout>

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "amazon-bedrock": {
      // ...
      "models": {
        "anthropic-claude-sonnet-4.5": {
          "id": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:xxx:application-inference-profile/yyy"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Anthropic

Once you've signed up, run the /connect command and select Anthropic.

```bash
/connect
```

Here you can select the Claude Pro/Max option and it'll open your browser and ask you to authenticate.

```bash
┌ Select auth method
│
│ Claude Pro/Max
│ Create an API Key
│ Manually enter API Key
└
```

Now all the Anthropic models should be available when you use the /models command.

```bash
/models
```

Using your Claude Pro/Max subscription in OpenCode is not officially supported by Anthropic.

#### Using API keys

You can also select Create an API Key if you don't have a Pro/Max option. It'll also open your browser and ask you to login to Anthropic and give you a code you can paste in your terminal.

Or if you already have an API key, you can select Manually enter API Key and paste it in your terminal.

</Callout>

### Self-Hosted GitLab

<Callout type="warning">
OpenCode uses a small model for some AI tasks like generating the session title. It is configured to use gpt-5-nano by default, hosted by Zen. To lock OpenCode to only use your own GitLab-hosted instance, add the following to your opencode.json file. It is also recommended to disable session sharing.
</Callout>

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "small_model": "gitlab/duo-chat-haiku-4-5",
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

For self-hosted GitLab instances:

```bash
export GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL=https://gitlab.company.com
export GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...
```

If your instance runs a custom AI Gateway:

```json
{
  "GITLAB_AI_GATEWAY_URL": "https://ai-gateway.company.com"
}
```

Or add to your bash profile:

```bash
export GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL=https://gitlab.company.com
export GITLAB_AI_GATEWAY_URL=https://ai-gateway.company.com
export GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...
```

<Callout type="note">
Your GitLab administrator must enable the following:

- Duo Agent Platform for the user, group, or instance
- Feature flags (via Rails console):
  - agent_platform_claude_code
  - third_party_agents_enabled
</Callout>

#### OAuth for Self-Hosted instances

In order to make Oauth working for your self-hosted instance, you need to create a new application (Settings → Applications) with the callback URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback and following scopes:

- api (Access the API on your behalf)
- read_user (Read your personal information)
- read_repository (Allows read-only access to the repository)

Then expose application ID as environment variable:

```bash
export GITLAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_application_id_here
```

More documentation on opencode-gitlab-auth homepage.

#### Configuration

Customize through opencode.json:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "gitlab": {
      "options": {
        "instanceUrl": "https://gitlab.com",

#### Optional Configs

In the event you see a feature or model from Helicone that isn't configured automatically through opencode, you can always configure it yourself.

Here's Helicone's Model Directory, you'll need this to grab the IDs of the models you want to add.

```jsonc
// ~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "helicone": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Helicone",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
      },
      "models": {
        "gpt-4o": {
          // Model ID (from Helicone's model directory page)
          "name": "GPT-4o", // Your own custom name for the model
        },
        "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": {
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

#### Custom Headers

Helicone supports custom headers for features like caching, user tracking, and session management. Add them to your provider config using options.headers:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "helicone": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Helicone",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
        "headers": {
          "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",
          "Helicone-User-Id": "opencode",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

#### Session tracking

Helicone's Sessions feature lets you group related LLM requests together. Use the opencode-helicone-session plugin to automatically log each OpenCode conversation as a session in Helicone.

```bash
npm install -g opencode-helicone-session
```

Add it to your config.

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-helicone-session"]
}
```

The plugin injects Helicone-Session-Id and Helicone-Session-Name headers into your requests. In Helicone's Sessions page, you'll see each OpenCode conversation listed as a separate session.

#### Common Helicone headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Helicone-Cache-Enabled | Enable response caching (true/false) |
| Helicone-User-Id | Track metrics by user |
| Helicone-Property-[Name] | Add custom properties (e.g., Helicone-Property-Environment) |
| Helicone-Prompt-Id | Associate requests with prompt versions |

See the Helicone Header Directory for all available headers.

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom provider

To add any OpenAI-compatible provider that's not listed in the /connect command:

<Callout type="tip">
You can use any OpenAI-compatible provider with opencode. Most modern AI providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs.
</Callout>

Run the /connect command and scroll down to Other.

```bash
$ /connect

┌  Add credential
│
◆  Select provider
│  ...
│  ● Other
└
```

Enter a unique ID for the provider.

```bash
$ /connect

┌  Add credential
│
◇  Enter provider id
│  myprovider
└
```

<Callout type="note">
Choose a memorable ID, you'll use this in your config file.
</Callout>

Enter your API key for the provider.

```bash
$ /connect

┌  Add credential
│
▲  This only stores a credential for myprovider - you will need to configure it in opencode.json, check the docs for examples.
│
◇  Enter your API key
│  sk-...
└
```

Create or update your opencode.json file in your project directory:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "myprovider": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1"
      },
      "models": {
        "my-model-name": {
          "name": "My Model Display Name"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here are the configuration options:

- npm: AI SDK package to use, @ai-sdk/openai-compatible for OpenAI-compatible providers
- name: Display name in UI.
- models: Available models.
- options.baseURL: API endpoint URL.
- options.apiKey: Optionally set the API key, if not using auth.
- options.headers: Optionally set custom headers.

More on the advanced options in the example below.

Run the /models command and your custom provider and models will appear in the selection list.

#### Example

Here's an example setting the apiKey, headers, and model limit options.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "myprovider": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1",
        "apiKey": "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer custom-token"
        }
      },
      "models": {
        "my-model-name": {
          "name": "My Model Display Name",
          "limit": {
            "context": 200000,
            "output": 65536
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Configuration details:

- apiKey: Set using env variable syntax, learn more.
- headers: Custom headers sent with each request.
- limit.context: Maximum input tokens the model accepts.
- limit.output: Maximum tokens the model can generate.

The limit fields allow OpenCode to understand how much context you have left. Standard providers pull these from models.dev automatically.

#### Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble with configuring a provider, check the following:

Check the auth setup: Run `opencode auth list` to see if the credentials for the provider are added to your config.

This doesn't apply to providers like Amazon Bedrock, that rely on environment variables for their auth.

For custom providers, check the opencode config and:

- Make sure the provider ID used in the /connect command matches the ID in your opencode config.
- The right npm package is used for the provider. For example, use @ai-sdk/cerebras for Cerebras. And for all other OpenAI-compatible providers, use @ai-sdk/openai-compatible.
- Check correct API endpoint is used in the options.baseURL field.
