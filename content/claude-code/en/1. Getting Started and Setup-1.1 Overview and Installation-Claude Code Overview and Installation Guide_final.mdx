## Prerequisites

Before starting with Claude Code, make sure you have the following:

- **Operating System**: macOS 13.0+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+ or Windows 10+ (supports WSL, WSL 2, or Git for Windows)
- **Hardware**: 4 GB+ RAM
- **Network Connection**: Stable internet connection
- **Shell Environment**: Bash or Zsh (recommended)
- **Account**: [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing) (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise) or [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) user

<Note>
Windows ARM64 does not support local sessions.
</Note>

## Quick Start: 30-Second Installation

### Step 1: Choose Installation Method

Claude Code offers multiple installation methods to fit different workflows.

**Option A: Native Installation (Recommended)**

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**
```batch
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

<ProTip>
Native installation automatically updates to the latest version in the background, ensuring you always have the latest features and security fixes.
</ProTip>

**Option B: Homebrew Installation**

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

<Note>
Homebrew installation does not auto-update. You need to periodically run `brew upgrade claude-code` to get the latest features and security fixes.
</Note>

**Option C: WinGet Installation**

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

<Note>
WinGet installation does not auto-update. You need to periodically run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` to get the latest features and security fixes.
</Note>

<ProTip>
For most users, native installation is the simplest and recommended method.
</ProTip>

### Step 2: Verify Installation

After installation is complete, run the following command to verify:

```bash
claude doctor
```

This will check your installation type and version, ensuring everything is working correctly.

### Step 3: Login to Your Account

On first use, the system will prompt you to login. You can use either of the following account types:

- **Claude Subscription** (recommended): Subscribe to Claude's [Pro or Max plan](https://claude.ai/pricing) to manage your account in one place
- **Claude Console**: Connect via [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/), requires active billing

Login command:

```bash
claude
# System will prompt you to login on first use
```

<Note>
When using Claude Console, the system automatically creates a "Claude Code" workspace for your organization to centrally manage usage tracking.
</Note>

<Note>
After logging in, your credentials will be stored, and you won't need to login again.
</Note>

### Step 4: Start Your First Session

After installing and logging in, navigate to your project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

<ProTip>
Ensure your project directory is a Git repository, so Claude Code can better understand your code structure.
</ProTip>

You will see Claude Code's welcome screen, which includes your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates.

## What Claude Code Can Do For You

### Build Features from Descriptions

Tell Claude in plain English what you want to build, and it will create a plan, write code, and ensure it works.

### Debug and Fix Issues

Describe an error or paste an error message, and Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.

### Navigate Any Codebase

Ask any question about your team's codebase, and Claude Code can provide thoughtful answers.

### Automate Tedious Tasks

Fix tricky lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all of this from your development machine with a single command.

### Why Developers Love Claude Code

#### Work in Your Terminal

Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, using the tools you already love.

#### Take Action

Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](/zh-CN/mcp) lets Claude read design docs from your Google Drive, update tickets in your Jira, or use your custom developer tools.

#### Unix Philosophy Design

Claude Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies"` *works*.

#### Enterprise Ready

Use the Claude API, or host on AWS, GCP. Enterprise-level security, [privacy](/zh-CN/data-usage), and [compliance](https://trust.anthropic.com/) are built-in.

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Quick Prototyping

```bash
# Describe feature
claude -p "Create a React form component with name, email, password fields. Use Material UI design."

# Let Claude generate complete component code
# Provide style reference
```

**Advantages:**
- Quick iteration and preview
- Claude automatically handles form validation and error handling
- Can easily modify UI styles

### Use Case 2: Code Review and Refactoring

```bash
# Let Claude analyze code quality
claude -p "Review the src/auth module for security best practices and potential improvements"

# Generate refactoring suggestions
claude -p "Convert src/utils functions to TypeScript types, add JSDoc type comments"
```

### Use Case 3: Multi-Project Coordination

```bash
# Work on multiple projects in one directory simultaneously
cd /workspace
for repo in project1 project2 project3; do
  claude -p "Generate independent Docker Compose configuration for each project"
done
```

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Command Line Mode Efficiently

One of Claude Code's most powerful features is `-p` flag for one-time tasks:

```bash
# Fix all lint errors
claude -p "Run 'npm run lint -- --fix' and accept all suggested changes"

# Quick code generation
claude -p "Generate an Express REST API endpoint with CRUD operations"
```

<ProTip>
When using `-p` mode, Claude Code focuses on completing the task without requesting interactive approval.
</ProTip>

### Tip 2: Break Down Complex Tasks Reasonably

For large tasks, break them into multiple smaller steps:

```bash
# First step
claude -p "Set up database schema and migration scripts"

# Second step
claude -p "Implement user authentication functionality"

# Third step
claude -p "Write API documentation"
```

### Tip 3: Fully Utilize Claude's Code Understanding Capabilities

Claude Code can deeply understand large codebases, make full use of this capability:

```bash
# Let Claude analyze the entire project architecture
claude -p "Identify design patterns and potential technical debt"

# Let Claude generate architecture documentation
```

## Common Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Installation Fails

**If installation script fails:**

**Check items:**
```bash
# Verify system requirements
claude doctor
```

**Check network connection:**
```bash
# Test network connection
curl -I https://claude.ai/
```

**Retry installation:**
```bash
# For native installation
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Problem 2: Permission Errors

If Claude Code refuses an operation:

- Check file permissions: `ls -la ~/.claude`
- View Claude Code configuration: `cat ~/.claude/settings.json`
- Run `claude config` interactively check permission settings

### Problem 3: Login Issues

**If login fails:**

- Check if account type is correct
- Verify network connection is working
- Try re-logging in with `/login` command

**If using Claude Console:**
- Ensure you have active billing
- Navigate to [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) to check billing status

### Problem 4: Slow Performance

**If response is slow:**

- Check network latency
- Try switching models (if subscription supports multiple models)
- Simplify conversation history: `/compact` removes unnecessary content

### Problem 5: Context Limits

**If encountering token limit errors:**

- This is a common issue for large documents or long sessions
- Use `/compact` to compress conversation history
- Split complex tasks into multiple sessions

### Problem 6: Tool Call Failures

**If Bash command execution fails:**

- Check error message and retry
- Verify command syntax is correct
