## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Claude Code, make sure you have the following:

- **Operating System**: macOS 13.0+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+ or Windows 10+ (with WSL 1, WSL 2, or Git for Windows)
- **Hardware**: 4 GB+ RAM
- **Network Connection**: Stable internet connection
- **Shell Environment**: Bash or Zsh (recommended)
- **Account**: [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing) (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise) or [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

Installing Claude Code is very simple. You have multiple installation options to choose from.

### Step 1.1: Native Installation (Recommended)

Native installation is the easiest way and supports automatic updates.

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**

```batch
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

<ProTip>
Native installation automatically updates to the latest version in the background, ensuring you always have the latest features and security fixes.
</ProTip>

### Step 1.2: Install Using Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

<Note>
Homebrew installation does not auto-update. You need to periodically run `brew upgrade claude-code` to get the latest features and security fixes.
</Note>

### Step 1.3: Install Using WinGet

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

<Note>
WinGet installation does not auto-update. You need to periodically run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode`.
</Note>

### Step 1.4: Verify Installation

After installation is complete, run the following command to verify:

```bash
claude doctor
```

## Step 2: Login to Your Account

On first use, the system will prompt you to login. You can use either of the following account types:

- **Claude subscription** (recommended): Subscribe to Claude's [Pro or Max plan](https://claude.ai/pricing) to manage your account in one place
- **Claude Console**: Connect via [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/), requires active billing

Login command:

```bash
claude
# System will prompt you to login on first use
```

You can also manually login:

```bash
/login
```

## Step 3: Start Your First Session

After installing and logging in, navigate to your project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

You will see Claude Code's welcome screen, which includes your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates.

### Step 3.1: Ask About Your Project

Start exploring your codebase:

```bash
# In Claude Code, type:
what does this project do?
```

```bash
# Or type:
explain the project structure
```

```bash
# Or ask about tech stack
what technologies does this project use?
```

### Step 3.2: Let Claude Modify Code

Describe what functionality you want, and Claude Code will automatically plan, write code, and make changes:

```bash
# Example
add input validation to the user registration form
fix the authentication bug
```

<Note>
Claude Code always asks for your approval before modifying files, giving you control over every change.
</Note>

## What Claude Code Can Do For You

### Build Features from Descriptions

Tell Claude in plain English what you want to build:

- **Quick Example**: "add a login form with email validation"
- **Detailed Description**: "create a REST API endpoint that accepts POST requests at /api/users with email validation, uses standard error response format"

### Debug and Fix Issues

Paste an error message or describe the problem, and Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the root cause, and implement a fix:

```bash
# Example
there's a bug where users see a blank screen after login - fix it
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable in my code
```

### Navigate Any Codebase

Claude Code maintains understanding of your entire project structure and can answer any question about your team's codebase:

```bash
# Example questions
where is the main entry point?
how does the authentication flow work?
what files handle database connections?
```

### Automate Tedious Tasks

Let Claude handle repetitive work, freeing up your time:

```bash
# Example
fix all lint issues
resolve merge conflicts
write release notes
```

<ProTip>
Claude can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits, making it perfect for these automation tasks.
</ProTip>

## Common Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

If installation fails:

- Check if system requirements are met
- Ensure network connection is working
- For Homebrew installation, ensure Homebrew is updated
- Run `claude doctor` to check installation type and version

### Permission Errors

If Claude refuses an operation, check your permission configuration.

### Login Issues

If login fails, verify:
- Account type is correct
- Network connection is working
- Subscription or Console account is valid

## Conclusion

Claude Code is a powerful AI programming assistant that can significantly improve your development efficiency. By following the steps above, you can get set up in minutes and start using its powerful features.

From simple code fixes to complex architecture refactoring, Claude Code can help you complete tasks faster. Its Unix philosophy design allows you to integrate it into existing workflows for true automated programming.
