   - Press `Tab` or `Esc` to accept current match and continue editing
   - Press `Enter` to accept and execute command immediately
5. **Cancel search**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and restore original input
   - Press `Backspace` on empty search to cancel

## Step 8: Use Background Tasks

### Step 8.1: Understand Background Execution Mechanism

Claude Code supports running bash commands in the background, allowing you to continue working while long-running processes execute.

**Background execution methods:**
- Prompt Claude Code to run a command in the background
- Press `Ctrl+B` to move a regular Bash tool call to the background

<Note>
Tmux users must press Ctrl+B twice because tmux uses it as a prefix key.
</Note>

### Step 8.2: Background Task Features

**Key Features:**
- Output is buffered and Claude can retrieve it using the TaskOutput tool
- Background tasks have unique IDs for tracking and output retrieval
- Background tasks are automatically cleaned up when Claude Code exits

**Common commands suitable for background execution:**
- Build tools (webpack, vite, make)
- Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Test runners (jest, pytest)
- Development servers
- Long-running processes (docker, terraform)

<ProTip>
Using background tasks allows you to continue other development work while waiting for compilation or testing.
</ProTip>

### Step 8.3: Use Bash Mode

Run bash commands directly by prefixing with `!`:

```bash
! npm test
! git status
! ls -la
```

**Bash Mode Features:**
- Adds the command and its output to the conversation context
- Shows real-time progress and output
- Supports background execution for long-running commands
- Doesn't require Claude to interpret or approve commands
- Supports history-based autocomplete

## Step 9: Use Task Lists

### Step 9.1: Understand Task List Functionality

When working on complex multi-step tasks, Claude creates task lists to track progress.

**Task List Operations:**
- Press `Ctrl+T` to toggle task list view (displays up to 10 tasks at a time)
- Ask Claude directly to show all tasks: "show me all tasks"
- Ask Claude directly to clear all tasks: "clear all tasks"
- Tasks persist through context compression

### Step 9.2: Share Task Lists Across Sessions

To share task lists, set `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID`:

```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=my-project claude
```
