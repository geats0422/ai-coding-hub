## Prerequisites

Accessing the analytics functionality requires the following:

- **Claude Console account**: Organization using Claude API for Claude Code
- **Appropriate permissions**: At least `Owner`, `Admin`, or `Developer` role
- **OAuth or API key authentication**: Properly configured

## Accessing Analytics Dashboard

### Navigation

Navigate to the analytics dashboard:
**URL**: [https://console.anthropic.com/claude-code](https://console.anthropic.com/claude-code)

This is the central management console for all Claude Code deployment-related features.

### Permission Requirements

The following roles can access analytics functionality:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Owner** | Full management permissions |
| **Admin** | Organization-level management permissions |
| **Bill Admin** | View spending-related data |
| **Developer** | View and analyze usage data |

<Note>
Users with `User`, `Claude Code User`, or `Member Admin` roles cannot access analytics features. If you need access, contact your organization administrator.
</Note>

## Key Metrics Dashboard

### Lines of Code Accepted

This metric displays the total number of lines of code that Claude Code has written and users have accepted in a session.

**What it tracks**:
- Code suggestions that users accepted (via Edit or Write tools)
- Excludes rejected suggestions
- Updates after code modifications

**Calculation rules**:
- Only counts accepted suggestions
- Does not track subsequent deletion operations
- Provides a direct measure of AI-generated code output

**Use cases**:
- **Evaluate AI output quality**: High acceptance rates indicate Claude is providing useful suggestions
- **Measure productivity**: Track code generation efficiency over time
- **Compare across users**: Identify power users who effectively leverage Claude Code

### Suggestion Acceptance Rate

Shows the percentage of code edit tool acceptances across these tool types:

**Covered tools**:
- **Edit**: Modifying existing code
- **Write**: Creating new files
- **NotebookEdit**: Notebook editing operations

**Calculation**:
- Acceptances ÷ Total Suggestions × 100
- Different rates by tool type

**Interpretation**:
- High acceptance rate (80%+) = Excellent AI quality, effective prompt engineering
- Medium rate (50-80%) = Good quality, reasonable clarity needed
- Low rate (&lt;50%) = May indicate need better prompt engineering

### Activity Metrics

**Active Users**: Distinct users who have used Claude Code in the given date range (displayed in left Y-axis)
- **Active Sessions**: Number of working sessions created (displayed in right Y-axis)

**Use cases**:
- **Adoption tracking**: Monitor active users to identify emerging users or declining usage
- **Participation trends**: Spikes or dips in user engagement indicate training needs or feature improvements

### Spend Metrics

**Total Spend**: Total dollar amount spent for the given date range (displayed in right Y-axis)

**Monthly Average**: Average spending per active user for the current month

**Code Output ROI**:
- Combine lines of code with total spend to calculate cost per line
- Helps evaluate efficiency of AI-assisted development

### Monthly Code Output

**Monthly Code Lines**: Total lines of code accepted by each active user in the current month

**Use cases**:
- **Productivity benchmarking**: Compare output across months to measure progress
- **Team efficiency**: Identify high performers vs. those needing support

## Team Insights

### Member Overview

**All Members**: Total number of unique users who have authenticated with Claude Code

**Member breakdown**:
- **API key users**: Identified by API key identifier
- **OAuth users**: Identified by email address
- Team members: Users within organization

This helps administrators understand adoption across different authentication methods and manage licenses effectively.

### Monthly Metrics

**This Month's Spend**: Current month's total Claude Code spending

**This Month's Code Output**: Lines of code accepted per user in current month

Combined analysis provides:
- Cost efficiency metrics (cost per line of code)
- Usage patterns by team member
- Productivity trends over time

### Effective Usage Analysis

Monitor adoption trends and identify opportunities:
- **Active users**: Who is consistently using Claude Code
- **High accepters**: Users getting the most value from suggestions
- **Power users**: Those generating significant code output
- **Team members with low adoption**: May need additional training or documentation

## Best Practices

### Regular Dashboard Review

**Schedule monthly reviews**: Analyze metrics and discuss trends with team leadership
- **Identify patterns**: Successful workflows to share with others
- **Address bottlenecks**: Users or tools with consistently low acceptance rates
- **Optimize costs**: Identify expensive models or overuse

### Share Insights

**Weekly/monthly highlights**: Send team summary emails covering:
- Top performers and their metrics
- Usage anomalies or issues
- New features or tools introduced

### Proactive Outreach

- **Onboarding support**: Help new users get started quickly with effective practices
- **Skill sharing**: Promote knowledge of power users and successful workflows
- **Documentation**: Provide clear guides on maximizing Claude Code value

## Integration with Other Features

### Combine with Telemetry

For comprehensive monitoring, use Claude Code's OpenTelemetry export alongside analytics:
- **Telemetry**: Real-time performance metrics and event tracking
- **Analytics**: Usage patterns and cost optimization insights
- **Correlation**: Link frontend errors with API failures for faster debugging

### Identity and Access Management

Proper role configuration ensures appropriate users have access to analytics, protecting sensitive information while enabling effective organizational decision-making.

## Conclusion

Claude Code analytics dashboard provides powerful data-driven decision capabilities for organizations. By tracking key metrics like code output, suggestion acceptance, active users, and spending patterns, managers can:
- ✅ Understand team-wide adoption and engagement
- ✅ Identify productivity trends and optimize resource allocation
- ✅ Make data-driven decisions about tool promotion and training
- ✅ Monitor return on investment in AI-assisted development

Regular review and sharing of insights will help the team continuously improve their workflows and maximize the value derived from Claude Code integration.
