# Codex IDE extended slash command

Slash commands let you control the Codex without leaving chat input. Use them to check status, switch between local and cloud modes, or send feedback.

## Use slash command

1. In the Codex chat input, type `/`.
2. Select a command from the list, or continue typing to filter (for example, `/status`).
