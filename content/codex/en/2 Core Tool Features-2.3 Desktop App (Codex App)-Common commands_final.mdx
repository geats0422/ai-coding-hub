## Slash commandSlash commands let you control the Codex without leaving the threaded editor. The available commands vary depending on your environment and access rights.

### Use slash command

1. In the thread editor, type `/`.
2. Select a command from the list, or continue typing to filter (for example, `/status`).

You can also invoke the skill explicitly by typing `$` in the thread editor. See [技能](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

Enabled skills also appear in the slash command list (e.g. `/imagegen`).

### Available slash commands

| slash command | description |
| -------- | ---- |
| `/feedback` | Opens the feedback dialog to submit feedback, optionally including logs. |
| `/mcp` | Open MCP status to view connected servers. |
| `/plan-mode` | Switch to the planning mode of multi-step planning. |
| `/review` | Start code review mode to review uncommitted changes or compare to the base branch. |
| `/status` | Shows thread ID, context usage, and rate limit. |
