# Codex SDK

If you use Codex via the Codex CLI, IDE extension, or Codex Web, you can also control it programmatically.

Use the SDK when:

- Control Codex as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Create your own agents that can interact with Codex to perform complex engineering tasks
- Build Codex into your own internal tools and workflows
- Integrate Codex in your own applications

## TypeScript library

TypeScript libraries provide a way to control Codex within an application that is more comprehensive and flexible than the non-interactive mode.

Use this on the server side; it requires Node.js 18 or higher.

### Installation

To get started, install the Codex SDK using `npm`:
```bas
npm install @openai/codex-sdk
```
### Use

Start a thread and run it with your prompt word.
```t
s


const codex = new Codex();
const thread = codex.startThread();
const result = await thread.run(
  "Make a plan to diagnose and fix the CI failures"
);

console.log(result);
```Call
 `run()` again to continue the same thread, or resume the past thread by providing the thread ID.
```t
s
// 运行同一个线程
const result = await thread.run("Implement the plan");

console.log(result);

// 恢复过去的线程

const threadId = "<thread-id>";
const thread2 = codex.resumeThread(threadId);
const result2 = await thread2.run("Pick up where you left off");

console.log(result2);
```
