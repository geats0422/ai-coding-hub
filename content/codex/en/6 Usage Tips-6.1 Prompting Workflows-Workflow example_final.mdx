# Workflow

Codex works best when you treat it as a teammate with explicit context and a clear definition of "done." This page provides end-to-end workflow examples for the Codex IDE extension, Codex CLI, and Codex Cloud.

If you are new to Codex, please read [提示词](https://developers.openai.com/codex/prompting) first and then come back here for the specific recipe.

<AdPlaceholder />

## How to read these examples

Each workflow includes:

- **When to use** and which Codex interface is best (IDE, CLI or cloud).
- **Steps** with example user prompts.
- **Contextual Notes**: What Codex automatically sees vs what you should attach.
- **Validation**: How to check the output.

<Callout type="note">
IDE extensions automatically use your open files as context. In the CLI, you usually need to mention the path explicitly (or attach files using `/mention` and `@` path auto-completion).
</Callout>

## Explain the code base

Use this feature when you are onboarding, inheriting a service, or trying to reason about protocols, data models, or request flows.

### IDE extended workflow (fastest for local exploration)



1. Open the most relevant file.
2. Select the code you care about (optional but recommended).
3. Prompt Codex:```
    Explain how the request flows through the selected code.

    Include:
    - a short summary of the responsibilities of each module involved
    - what data is validated and where
    - one or two "gotchas" to watch for when changing this
    ```

Verification:

- Ask for a chart or a checklist you can quickly verify:```
    Summarize the request flow as a numbered list of steps. Then list the files involved.
    ```### CLI workflow (good when you want to log + shell commands)



1. Start an interactive session:```bash
    codex
    ```2. Attach files (optional) and prompt:```
    I need to understand the protocol used by this service. Read @foo.ts @schema.ts and explain the schema and request/response flow. Focus on required vs optional fields and backward compatibility rules.
    ```

Contextual notes:

- You can use `@` to insert a file path in the editor, or `/mention` to append a specific file.

---

## Fix Bug

Use this feature when you have failing behavior that can be reproduced locally.

### CLI workflow (tight loop with reproduction and verification)



1. Start Codex in the warehouse root directory:```bash
    codex
    ```2. Give Codex the steps to reproduce, and the file you suspect:```
    Bug: Clicking "Save" on the settings screen sometimes shows "Saved" but doesn't persist the change.

    Repro:
    1) Start the app: npm run dev
    2) Go to /settings
    3) Toggle "Enable alerts"
    4) Click Save
    5) Refresh the page: the toggle resets

    Constraints:
    - Do not change the API shape.
    - Keep the fix minimal and add a regression test if feasible.

    Start by reproducing the bug locally, then propose a patch and run checks.
    ```

Contextual notes:

- Provided by you: Reproduction steps and constraints (these are more important than the high-level description).
- 由 Codex 提供：命令输出、发现的调用站点以及它触发的任何堆栈跟踪。

Verification:

- Codex should be re-run with the reproduction steps after fixing.
- If you have the standard inspection pipeline, ask it to run it:```
    After the fix, run lint + the smallest relevant test suite. Report the commands and results.
    ```### IDE extension workflow



1. Open the file where you think the error is located and its most recent caller.
2. Prompt Codex:```
    Find the bug causing "Saved" to show without persisting changes. After proposing the fix, tell me how to verify it in the UI.
    ```

---

## Write tests

Use this feature when you want to very specifically specify the range you want to test.

### IDE extended workflow (selection based)



1. Open the file containing the function.
2. Select the row where the function is defined. Select "Add to Codex Thread" from the command palette to add these lines to the context.
3. Prompt Codex:```
    Write a unit test for this function. Follow conventions used in other tests.
    ```

Contextual notes:

- Provided by the "Add to Codex Thread" command: the selected lines (this is the "line number" range), plus the open file.

### CLI workflow (path + line range described in prompt word)



1. Start Codex:```bash
    codex
    ```2. Use function name hints:```
    Add a test for the invert_list function in @transform.ts. Cover the happy path plus edge cases.
    ```

---

## Based on screenshot prototype

Use this feature when you have a design mockup, screenshot, or UI reference and you want a quick working prototype.

### CLI workflow (image + prompt word)



1. Save your screenshot locally (e.g. `./specs/ui.png`).
2. Run Codex:```bash
    codex
    ```3. Drag the image file into the terminal to attach it to the prompt word.

4. Continue adding constraints and structures:```
    Create a new dashboard based on this image.

    Constraints:
    - Use react, vite, and tailwind. Write the code in typescript.
    - Match spacing, typography, and layout as closely as possible.

    Deliverables:
    - A new route/page that renders the UI
    - Any small components needed
    - README.md with instructions to run it locally
    ```

Contextual notes:

- Images provide visual requirements, but you still need to specify implementation constraints (framework, routing, component styles) in the text.
- For best results, include any non-obvious behavior (hover states, validation rules, keyboard interaction) in the text.

Verification:

- Ask Codex to run the development server (if allowed) and tell you where to view the prototype:```
    Start the dev server and tell me the local URL/route to view the prototype.
    ```### IDE workflow (image + existing file)



1. Attach an image in Codex chat (drag and drop or paste).
2. Prompt Codex:```
    Create a new settings page. Use the attached screenshot as the target UI.
    Follow design and visual patterns from other files in this project.
    ```

---

## Iterate the UI with real-time updates

Use this feature when you want a tight "Design → Adjust → Refresh → Adjust" loop while Codex edits the code.

### CLI workflow (run Vite, then iterate using small prompt words)



1. Start Codex:```bash
    codex
    ```2. Start the development server in a separate terminal window:```bash
    npm run dev
    ```3. Prompt Codex to make changes:```
    Propose 2-3 styling improvements for the landing page.
    ```4. Choose a direction and iterate using small, specific prompt words:```
    Go with option 2.

    Change only the header:
    - make the typography more editorial
    - increase whitespace
    - ensure it still looks good on mobile
    ```5. Repeat with focus request:```
    Next iteration: reduce visual noise.
    Keep the layout, but simplify colors and remove any redundant borders.
    ```

Verification:

- See changes "live" in your browser as your code is updated.
- Commit changes you like and roll back changes you don't.
- Tell Codex if you roll back or modify changes so that it does not overwrite the changes when processing the next prompt word.

## Delegate refactoring to the cloud

Use this feature when you want to carefully design (local context, quick inspection) and then offload the long implementation to a cloud task that can run in parallel.

### Local planning (IDE)



1. Make sure your current work is committed or at least staged so you can cleanly compare changes.
2. Ask Codex to generate a refactoring plan. If you have the `$plan` skill available, call it explicitly:```
    $plan

    We need to refactor the auth subsystem to:
    - split responsibilities (token parsing vs session loading vs permissions)
    - reduce circular imports
    - improve testability

    Constraints:
    - No user-visible behavior changes
    - Keep public APIs stable
    - Include a step-by-step migration plan
    ```3. Review the plan and negotiate changes:```
    Revise the plan to:
    - specify exactly which files move in each milestone
    - include a rollback strategy
    ```

Contextual notes:

- Planning works best when Codex can scan the current code locally (entry points, module boundaries, dependency graph hints).

### Cloud delegation (IDE → Cloud)



1. If you have not already done so, set up [云环境](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/environments) for the Codex.
2. Click the cloud icon below the prompt editor and select your cloud environment.
3. When you enter the next prompt word, Codex creates a new thread in the cloud that carries the existing thread context (including schedule and any local source changes).```
    Implement Milestone 1 from the plan.
    ```4. Review cloud differences and iterate as needed.

5. Create a PR directly from the cloud, or pull changes locally for testing and completion.

6. Additional milestones for iteration planning.



---

## Perform local code review

Use this feature when you want to get a second set of eyes before submitting or creating a PR.

### CLI workflow (review your work tree)



1. Start Codex:```bash
    codex
    ```2. Run the review command:```
    /review
    ```3. Optional: Provide clear key points:```
    /review Focus on edge cases and security issues
    ```

Verification:

- Apply the fix based on review feedback and rerun `/review` to confirm the issue is resolved.

---

## Review GitHub pull requests

Use this feature when you want to review feedback without pulling the branch locally.

Enable Codex **Code Review** on your repository before using this feature. Please see [代码审查](https://developers.openai.com/codex/integrations/github).

### GitHub workflow (comment driven)



1. Open a pull request on GitHub.
2. Leave a comment tagged Codex and identify key areas:```
    @codex review
    ```3. Optional: Provide more explicit instructions.```
    @codex review for security vulnerabilities and security concerns
    ```

---

## Update documentation

Use this feature when you need accurate and clear document changes.

### IDE or CLI workflow (local editing + local verification)



1. Identify the documentation files you want to change and open them (IDE) or `@` mention them (IDE or CLI).
2. Prompt the Codex with scope and validation requirements:```
    Update the "advanced features" documentation to provide authentication troubleshooting guidance. Verify that all links are valid.
    ```3. After drafting changes in Codex, review the document and iterate as necessary.



Verification:

- Read the rendered page.
