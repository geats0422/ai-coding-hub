Custom commands let you specify a prompt you want to run when that command is executed in the TUI.

```bash
/my-command
```

Custom commands are in addition to the built-in commands like /init, /undo, /redo, /share, /help. Learn more.

## Create command files

Create markdown files in the commands/ directory to define custom commands.

Create .opencode/commands/test.md:

```yaml
---
description: Run tests with coverage
agent: build
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.
Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The frontmatter defines command properties. The content becomes the template.

Use the command by typing / followed by the command name.

```bash
"/test"
```

## Configure

You can add custom commands through the OpenCode config or by creating markdown files in the commands/ directory.

### JSON

Use the command option in your OpenCode config:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "command": {
    // This becomes the name of the command
    "test": {
      // This is the prompt that will be sent to the LLM
      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.",
      // This is shown as the description in the TUI
      "description": "Run tests with coverage",
      "agent": "build",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    }
  }
}
```

Now you can run this command in the TUI:

```bash
/test
```

### Markdown

You can also define commands using markdown files. Place them in:

- Global: ~/.config/opencode/commands/
- Per-project: .opencode/commands/

```yaml
---
description: Run tests with coverage
agent: build
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.
Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The markdown file name becomes the command name. For example, test.md lets you run:

```bash
/test
```

## Prompt config

The prompts for the custom commands support several special placeholders and syntax.

### Arguments

Pass arguments to commands using the $ARGUMENTS placeholder.

```yaml
---
description: Create a new component
---

Create a new React component named $ARGUMENTS with TypeScript support.
Include proper typing and basic structure.
```

Run the command with arguments:

```bash
/component Button
```

And $ARGUMENTS will be replaced with Button.

You can also access individual arguments using positional parameters:

- $1 - First argument
- $2 - Second argument
- $3 - Third argument
- And so on…

For example:

```yaml
---
description: Create a new file with content
---

Create a file named $1 in the directory $2
with the following content: $3
```

Run the command:

```bash
/create-file config.json src "{ \"key\": \"value\" }"
```

This replaces:

- $1 with config.json
- $2 with src
- $3 with `{ "key": "value" }`

### Shell output

Use !command to inject bash command output into your prompt.

For example, to create a custom command that analyzes test coverage:

```yaml
---
description: Analyze test coverage
---

Here are the current test results:
!`npm test`

Based on these results, suggest improvements to increase coverage.
```

Or to review recent changes:

```yaml
---
description: Review recent changes
---

Recent git commits:
!`git log --oneline -10`

Review these changes and suggest any improvements.
```

Commands run in your project's root directory and their output becomes part of the prompt.

### File references

Include files in your command using @ followed by the filename.

```yaml
---
description: Review component
---

Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx.
Check for performance issues and suggest improvements.
```

The file content gets included in the prompt automatically.

## Options

Let's look at the configuration options in detail.

### Template

The template option defines the prompt that will be sent to the LLM when the command is executed.

```json
{
  "command": {
    "test": {
      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes."
    }
  }
}
```

This is a required config option.

### Description

Use the description option to provide a brief description of what the command does.

```json
{
  "command": {
    "test": {
      "description": "Run tests with coverage"
    }
  }
}
```

This is shown as the description in the TUI when you type in the command.

### Agent

Use the agent config to optionally specify which agent should execute this command. If this is a subagent the command will trigger a subagent invocation by default. To disable this behavior, set subtask to false.

```json
{
  "command": {
    "review": {
      "agent": "plan"
    }
  }
}
```

This is an optional config option. If not specified, defaults to your current agent.

### Subtask

Use the subtask boolean to force the command to trigger a subagent invocation. This is useful if you want the command to not pollute your primary context and will force the agent to act as a subagent, even if mode is set to primary on the agent configuration.

```json
{
  "command": {
    "analyze": {
      "subtask": true
    }
  }
}
```

This is an optional config option.

### Model

Use the model config to override the default model for this command.

```json
{
  "command": {
    "analyze": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    }
  }
}
```

This is an optional config option.

## Built-in

opencode includes several built-in commands like /init, /undo, /redo, /share, /help; learn more.

<Callout type="note">
Custom commands can override built-in commands.
</Callout>

If you define a custom command with the same name, it will override the built-in command.
