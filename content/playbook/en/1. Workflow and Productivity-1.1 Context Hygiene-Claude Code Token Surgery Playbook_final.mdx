# You Think You're Coding, But You're Paying Zombie Context Tax

## 0x00. The Matrix (What Actually Goes Wrong)

Late at night, I was fixing a small script bug in Claude Code while rushing an online class deadline.
I forgot to clean the session first, so half an hour of failed attempts, noisy logs, and unrelated chat stayed in context.
Every new message kept paying for old garbage.

The day before, I got stuck on a Vercel account binding issue.
Then I spent time debugging a Cloudflare DNS record for `aicodinghub.dev`.
When context gets dirty, judgment slows down and execution drifts.

What looks like "the model got worse" is often session hygiene failure.

## 0x01. The Way (Three Hygiene Tools)

Treat Claude Code like an entropy-accumulating machine, not a chat box.

- `/clear`: hard reset when switching tasks.
- `/compact [instructions]`: compress a long chain and preserve only actionable state.
- `/context`: monitor usage and intervene early.

> Official docs confirm `/clear`, `/compact`, and auto-compaction near context limits.
> They do not provide a fixed threshold; "95%" appears in issue discussions and should be treated as unverified behavior.

## 0x02. Pre-Flight (30 Seconds Before Work)

- [ ] `claude` runs on your machine
- [ ] You know slash commands run inside Claude interactive sessions, not system shell
- [ ] You have a concrete goal: plan, current failure, next step
- [ ] Optional: keep compact rules in `CLAUDE.md` for team consistency

## 0x03. Enter the Session

```bash
claude --version
```

```bash
claude
```

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
## Compact Instructions
When compacting, keep only:
1) implementation plan
2) last error message
3) modified files list
```

## 0x04. Two High-Frequency Scenarios

### Scenario A: Task complete, immediate cold start

Move fast. Do not hesitate.

> These slash commands run inside Claude Code interactive mode, not your shell.

```text
/rename feat-auth-token-rotation
```

```text
/clear
```

```text
Conversation history cleared.
Start a new prompt.
```

### Scenario B: Session grows long, compact manually

You can wait for auto-compaction, but that usually means you are already near the boundary.
My default is to intervene around halfway to keep room for controlled execution.

```text
/context
```

```text
Context window usage: 52%
```

```text
/compact "Keep only the implementation plan and last error message"
```

```text
Compacted conversation with focus instructions.
Preserved key plan and latest failure context.
```

Rule of thumb: keep executable state, drop narrative noise.

## 0x05. Pitfalls and Fixes

### Error 1: Compacting too late

Symptom: responses drift and rework the same point.

Fix:

```text
/context
```

```text
/compact "Keep only the implementation plan, current branch, modified files, and last error message"
```

### Error 2: Switching tasks without clearing

Symptom: old terminology leaks into the new task.

Fix:

```text
/rename feat-auth-token-rotation-next
```

```text
/clear
```

```text
/resume
```

Replace `feat-auth-token-rotation-next` with your own task name.

### Error 3: Blaming model quality for context pollution

Symptom: you spend many rounds on a tiny bug with no forward progress.

Fix: stop, clear, restate the goal in three lines: what to change, where to change it, how to verify it.

## 0x06. Wrap-Up

I now treat this as hygiene, not a trick.

Switch tasks: `/clear`.
Long chain: `/context` + `/compact`.
Do not wait for the system to save you.

This is not a slogan.
It is a way to spend compute on outcomes and keep attention for hard problems.

## Sources (Evidence and Status)

### Confirmed (Official)

1. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode`
   - `/clear`: clear conversation history
   - `/compact [instructions]`: compact conversation with optional focus instructions

2. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs`
   - auto-compaction triggers near context limits
   - docs recommend proactive context hygiene (`/clear`, `/compact`)

3. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices`
   - recommend `/clear` between unrelated tasks and active context management in long sessions

### Needs Verification

1. "Auto-compact always triggers at a fixed 95% threshold"
   - not documented as a fixed number in official docs
   - related discussion: `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/15719`

2. "You must intervene at 50%"
   - this is an operational strategy, not an official hard rule
   - valid as team SOP if labeled as convention
