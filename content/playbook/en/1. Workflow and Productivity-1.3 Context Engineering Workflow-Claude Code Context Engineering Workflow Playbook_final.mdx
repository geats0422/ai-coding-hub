# Stop Treating AI Like Autocomplete: Claude Code Context Engineering Workflow Playbook

<img src={contextWorkflowImageEn} alt="Claude Code context engineering workflow diagram" />

> **Drive intelligence, gain leverage.**
> You do not lack model power. You lack context engineering and a verification loop.

## 0x00. The Matrix (Agitate)

You ask AI to write code. It does write code.
Then you rework. Rework again. Explain everything again.

The issue is rarely model capability. The issue is treating chat as infinite cache:

- old task noise leaks into new tasks and collapses decision boundaries;
- no local memory files, so rules drift with session history;
- no build/test loop, so output looks right but breaks at runtime.

This is not just efficiency loss. It is control loss.

## 0x01. The Paradigm Shift (Features)

High-leverage Claude Code usage is not "ask one more prompt." It is upgrading it into a governed execution agent:

- **Local memory takeover**: use `CLAUDE.md` to lock architecture constraints, naming rules, and verification commands.
- **Built-in verification loop**: encode lint/test/build rules and enforce post-edit self-check.
- **Stateless parallel execution**: run multiple tasks with terminals + Git worktrees; rely on `/compact` and local docs, not long-session memory.

> Official docs confirm `/init`, `/clear`, and `/compact`.
> You can enforce a 300-line team discipline, but official guidance is roughly keeping `CLAUDE.md` within about 500 lines.

## 0x02. The System: Prerequisites

- [ ] Claude Code installed and runnable via `claude`
- [ ] Git repository initialized (for worktree isolation)
- [ ] Project has executable validation commands (`npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`)
- [ ] Team adopts `CLAUDE.md` as engineering memory entrypoint (`CLAUDE.local.md` optional for personal preferences)

## 0x03. The Execution: Deployment

```bash
claude --version
```

```bash
claude
```

```text
/init
```

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Architecture Constraints
- Follow top-down module boundaries; no cross-layer imports.
- Keep feature logic inside `src/features/*`.

## Verification Protocol
- After each edit batch, run:
  1) npm run lint
  2) npm run test
  3) npm run build
- If any command fails, fix root cause and re-run all three.

## Compact Instructions
- Preserve only: implementation plan, changed files, last error message.
```

## 0x04. The Workflow

### Scenario 1: Memory Injection

Goal: constrain AI behavior into a repeatable engineering protocol through local memory files.

```text
/init
```

```text
/memory
```

```text
Implement feature X. Follow CLAUDE.md verification protocol.
Run lint/test/build after coding and fix failures before final output.
```

```text
Expected: Claude edits files -> runs commands -> reports pass/fail -> self-corrects.
```

> Official guidance: put common build/test/lint commands into `CLAUDE.md` to remove repeated searching.

### Scenario 2: Stateless Parallelism

Goal: isolate code state across concurrent tasks while keeping context fresh.

```bash
git worktree add ../proj-feature-a -b feature-a
```

```bash
git worktree add ../proj-bugfix bugfix-123
```

```bash
git worktree list
```

```bash
cd ../proj-feature-a
```

```bash
claude
```

```text
/compact "Keep only the implementation plan and last error message"
```

```text
/clear
```

```text
Expected: each worktree owns isolated file state, sessions stay task-focused.
```

> Persist critical decisions into local docs (for example `docs/DECISIONS.md`), not only chat history.

## 0x05. Troubleshooting

### Error: Context bloat makes long sessions drift

Fix:

```text
/context
```

```text
/compact "Keep only implementation plan, changed files, and last error"
```

```text
/clear
```

```text
/memory
```

### Error: MCP overload saturates context with tool descriptions

Fix:

```text
/mcp
```

```bash
claude mcp list
```

```bash
claude mcp remove <UNUSED_SERVER_NAME>
```

Use `claude mcp list` first to get names. Example: `claude mcp remove github`.

```bash
ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=auto:5 claude
```

> Official docs confirm each MCP server adds context overhead. Disable unused ones and prefer CLI tooling (`gh`, `aws`, `gcloud`) when possible.

## 0x06. The Ascension

Upgrading AI from autocomplete to autonomous execution is not magic.
It is three operating principles:

1. local memory files
2. verification loop
3. stateless parallelism

Ship this today: `/init` your protocol, run one worktree-parallel round, then persist key logic with `/compact` and local docs.

**Drive intelligence, gain leverage.**

## Sources (Evidence and Status)

### Confirmed (Official)

1. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode`
   - `/init`: Initialize project with `CLAUDE.md` guide
   - `/clear`: Clear conversation history
   - `/compact [instructions]`: Compact conversation with optional focus instructions

2. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory`
   - bootstrap `CLAUDE.md` with `/init`
   - project memory paths: `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   - auto memory loads first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md`

3. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices`
   - recommends `/init`
   - recommends storing build/test/lint commands in `CLAUDE.md`

4. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows`
   - official worktree workflow: `git worktree add/list/remove`

5. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs`
   - each MCP server adds context overhead
   - disable unused servers and lower tool-search threshold when needed

6. `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp`
   - Tool Search triggers when MCP tool descriptions exceed 10% context
   - threshold adjustable via `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=auto:<N>`

### Need Verification

1. "`CLAUDE.md` must be under 300 lines"
   - no official hard limit at 300 lines
   - official guidance is around 500 lines
   - 300 can be a team policy, not a platform rule

2. "Selective MCP enablement by subdirectory is the only correct strategy"
   - official docs support scoping and on-demand disablement
   - no official single mandatory directory strategy
