# Drop Manual Setup: Codex + Supabase Multi-Agent Workflow from Weeks to Minutes

## 0x00. The Matrix

How long did your last "from-zero full-stack setup" take?

Three days? One week?

Most teams still follow this default path:

- open editor, initialize project, wire Git;
- scaffold frontend framework, routes, and UI library;
- implement backend APIs, migrations, and indexes;
- hand-write database security policies and retest repeatedly;
- debug CORS, auth, session, and integration issues;
- burn energy on sync overhead instead of product delivery.

That is not leverage. That is avoidable operational drag.

## 0x01. The Paradigm Shift

Now switch to a workflow built for throughput:

- **Fast inference loop**: high-speed model output shortens wait time from minutes to seconds.
- **Parallel multi-agent execution**: Frontend Agent, Backend Agent, and Main Agent work concurrently.
- **Security as flow**: Supabase RLS policies are generated and applied in the same delivery cycle.

This is the practical value of **Codex + Supabase + Multi-Agent Parallel Workflow**.

### Core Features

- **Feature 1: fast generation loop**: complete modules can be produced in one instruction cycle.
- **Feature 2: parallel agent orchestration**: Main Agent aligns scope while frontend and backend move in parallel.
- **Feature 3: repeatable data security**: RLS policy templates are produced and executed with implementation.

## 0x02. The System: Prerequisites

- [ ] GitHub account for Codex repository integration
- [ ] Supabase account for project, schema, and credentials
- [ ] Cerebras API key for Spark model access (`https://cerebras.ai`)
- [ ] Node.js >= 18 for local runtime
- [ ] Claude Opus 4.6 (optional) for architecture review on long-running tasks

## 0x03. The Execution: Deployment

### Step 1: connect Codex to GitHub

```bash
# In Codex App:
# 1. Settings -> Integrations -> GitHub
# 2. Connect and authorize repository access
# 3. Select existing repo or create a new one
```

### Step 2: create Supabase project and collect credentials

```bash
# In supabase.com create a project and collect:
# - SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
# - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE>
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE>
```

### Step 3: configure environment variables

```env
# .env.local
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=<YOUR_CEREBRAS_API_KEY_HERE>
SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE>
GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE>
```

## 0x04. The Workflow

### Scenario: from prompt to full-stack delivery

Main Agent instruction:

```text
Build a user authentication system with:
1) Obsidian-style minimal dark UI
2) user sign-up and sign-in
3) API key authentication
4) audit logging
5) Supabase persistence with RLS policies

Assign Frontend Agent to UI, Backend Agent to API, Main Agent to spec alignment.
```

Expected output:

- Frontend Agent: `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/styles/`
- Backend Agent: `src/api/`, `src/middleware/auth.ts`, `src/utils/logger.ts`
- Main Agent: `SPEC.md`, `supabase/migrations/`, and RLS setup

```sql
-- Example Supabase RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own data"
ON users
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only insert their own data"
ON users
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 0x05. Troubleshooting

### Pitfall 1: unstable work trees causing agent drop

- Symptom: one parallel agent loses state mid-run
- Fix: pin the thread in Codex

```bash
# In Codex:
# 1. Open Agent panel
# 2. Right click target agent -> Pin Thread
# 3. Confirm pinned state remains active
```

### Pitfall 2: exposed Supabase data

- Symptom: table access is too open
- Fix: enforce RLS explicitly

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE api_keys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for authenticated users"
ON users FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Pitfall 3: architecture debt in long-running projects

- Symptom: velocity drops as code quality degrades
- Fix: schedule architecture review every ~1000 lines of net changes

```bash
# In Codex:
# "Review current architecture, identify technical debt, and propose refactor plan."
```

## 0x06. The Ascension

You now have a minutes-level delivery workflow from idea to full-stack output.

1. register Cerebras + Supabase;
2. run this workflow for your first project;
3. reinvest saved time into product value, not setup churn.
