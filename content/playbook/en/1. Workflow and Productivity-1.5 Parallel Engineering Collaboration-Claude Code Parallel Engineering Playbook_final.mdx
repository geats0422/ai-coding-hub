# You Don't Lack a Model, You Lack a Collaboration Protocol: Claude Code Parallel Engineering Playbook

> **Drive intelligence, gain leverage.**
> You are not hitting a model ceiling. You are still using serial-era habits for parallel-era tools.

## 0x00. The Matrix (Agitate)

This default path probably feels familiar:

- handle requirements, bugs, refactors, and verification in one session;
- mix planning and implementation, then push forward even after drift;
- explain rules in chat but never persist them in `CLAUDE.md`;
- switch across Slack, CI, logs, and terminal while fixing issues;
- overload the main agent until context gets saturated by noise.

This is not a motivation problem.

It is protocol debt and psychic entropy: you think you are making progress, but you are amplifying bad feedback loops.

## 0x01. The Paradigm Shift (Features)

The highest-leverage way to use Claude Code is not writing longer prompts. It is establishing a parallel engineering protocol.

- **Parallel surface**: use `git worktree` or multi-checkout to run implementation, verification, and analysis in parallel.
- **Plan first**: review plan mode before implementation; when drift appears, return to planning immediately.
- **Memory compounding**: write every correction back to `CLAUDE.md` and project notes so the same mistake is not repeated.

## 0x02. The System: Prerequisites

- [ ] Claude Code CLI installed and runnable via `claude`
- [ ] Git initialized locally for worktree parallelism
- [ ] Project supports executable `lint/test/build` verification commands
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` (project rules) and `docs/NOTES.md` (task memory) prepared
- [ ] Required credentials configured as needed

## 0x03. The Execution: Deployment

```bash
claude --version
```

```bash
claude
```

```text
/init
```

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Verification Protocol
- After each change batch, run:
  1) npm run lint
  2) npm run test
  3) npm run build
- If any check fails, fix root cause and rerun all checks.

## Context Hygiene
- If plan drifts, switch to plan mode and re-plan.
- Use /compact to keep only implementation plan and latest error.
```

```env
# .env.example
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=auto:10
```

## 0x04. The Workflow

### Scenario 1: Parallel implementation + plan review

Goal: deliver complex features with stable parallel lanes.

```bash
git worktree add ../proj-feature-a -b feature-a
git worktree add ../proj-verify verify-a
git worktree list
```

```text
In the feature-a session:
- Start with plan mode and define input, constraints, acceptance criteria, rollback, and verification commands.
- Review the plan only.
- Execute implementation only after plan approval.
```

```text
Expected:
- implementation and verification lanes remain isolated
- drift is detected early and moved back to planning
- change reports include "what changed + verification + rollback path"
```

### Scenario 2: Evidence-driven bug healing

Goal: replace guessing with evidence loops.

```text
Feed Claude Code direct evidence:
- Slack bug thread
- failing CI output
- docker logs
```

```text
Prompt:
Go fix the failing CI tests.
Return: changed files, verification commands, and why this fix is root-cause level.
```

```text
Expected:
- root cause before edits
- automatic lint/test/build execution
- auditable explanation for the fix
```

## 0x05. Troubleshooting

- Error: long sessions drift and decision quality degrades (Context Bloat)
  - Fix:

```text
/compact "Keep only implementation plan, changed files, and last error"
/clear
/memory
```

- Error: repeated mistakes as if the agent has no memory
  - Fix:

```text
Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again.
```

```markdown
In CLAUDE.md add: error pattern, trigger, verification command, forbidden action
```

- Error: main session collapses under sub-task load
  - Fix:

```text
use subagents
```

```text
Offload independent tasks to subagents; keep main session for spec alignment and final acceptance.
```

## 0x06. The Ascension

You do not need to chase the next stronger model.

You need a stable compounding protocol: parallel execution, plan-first delivery, memory persistence, and evidence loops.

Do one thing today: split your next complex task into 3 parallel lanes, plan first, then implement, and write every recurring error back into `CLAUDE.md`.

When the system starts enforcing discipline for you, you move from busyness to leverage.

**Drive intelligence, gain leverage.**
