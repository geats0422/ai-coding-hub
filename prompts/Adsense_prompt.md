# Role
You are a Senior Ad Ops Strategist & SEO Expert specializing in monetizing technical documentation websites for publishers in Mainland China. You understand the specific payment constraints (Hyperwallet, Wire Transfer limits) and content policies (Low Value Content).

# Context
I have developed a static tutorial website for AI coding tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) using Next.js.
- **Content Source:** Official documentation rewritten with personal insights.
- **Target Audience:** Developers and AI enthusiasts.
- **Current Status:** Deployed on Vercel (free subdomain), no traffic yet.
- **Revenue Goal:** >$100/month.
- **Location & Payment:** Mainland China. I have a **China Merchants Bank (CMB) Debit Card**, **PayPal**, and **Wise**. I do NOT want to use Crypto.

# Your Task
Please analyze my situation and generate a comprehensive diagnostic report covering the following 3 sections:

## Section 1: AdSense Eligibility & "Low Value Content" (LVC) Prevention
Since my content is based on official docs, I am at high risk of LVC rejection. Provide a strict checklist:
1.  **Domain Strategy:** Explain why I MUST buy a Top-Level Domain (TLD) and cannot use `*.vercel.app`. Recommend a TLD (e.g., .com vs .tech) that balances trust and cost.
2.  **Content "Value Add" Framework:** Provide 3 specific templates/strategies to transform "Official Docs" into "Original Content" (e.g., "The 'Vs.' Comparison Strategy", "Error Log Analysis Strategy").
3.  **Payment Setup for China (Crucial):** Explain how to leverage the new **"PayPal Hyperwallet"** option for AdSense China to receive funds directly to my CMB card or PayPal, avoiding the $100 wire transfer threshold issues.

## Section 2: Alternative Network Selection (The "Adsterra" Strategy)
I need to pair AdSense with **Adsterra** (Selected for its payment flexibility). Please analyze:
1.  **Why Adsterra fits me:** Explain the benefit of Adsterra's **"Local Bank Transfer (Hyperwallet)"** feature which has a **$25 minimum payout**, compared to standard Wire Transfers.
2.  **Ad Format Strategy:** Since I hate intrusive ads (Popunders), explain how to configure Adsterra's **"Social Bar"** or **"Native Banners"** to be developer-friendly.
3.  **Wise Integration:** Briefly mention if I can use my **Wise USD Account** details (ACH/Routing No.) to receive payments from Adsterra/AdSense to further lower fees.

## Section 3: Technical Launch Checklist
1.  **Legal Pages:** List the exact pages (Privacy Policy, Terms, etc.) required for approval.
2.  **Deployment:** Steps to bind the new custom domain to Vercel and verify `ads.txt`.

# Output Format
Provide the response as a structured, actionable "Launch Checklist" suitable for a Product Manager.
